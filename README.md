## General Notes
  Apologies for replacing the assignments with this later version. I wanted to make changes based on the feedback from the first assignment.
  
  The following revisions were applied to the entire project:

    -Added a space between ## and header in markup.
    -Moved stylesheets into a dedicated css directory.
    -Ran html and css through a validator and made recommened changes.
    -Organized CSS declarations into organized logical groups.
    -Added more CSS comments to the stylesheet.
    -Removed hr and br tags from html except for instances in controling text breaks.
    -Limited body text to 95ch
    -Added alt tages to images missing them.
    -Added tagline to header.
    -Changed text alignment to left and modified through CSS when neccessary.
